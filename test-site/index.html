    <h1>Rock Climbing: Physical Problem Solving</h1>
    <img class="blocking" src="images/secong-image.jpeg" alt="My test image" />
    <p>
      Rock climbing accross the board is a challenging sport and is known to be
      pretty demanding physically. To be able to climb grand walls takes
      strength in the following areas:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Arms</li>
      <li>Fingers</li>
      <li>Abs</li>
      <li>Legs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, just as much as the sport is physically challenging, it is just
      as much a brain gain as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most new climbers understand the physical requirements of the sport, even
      if they dont meet some of them initially. How, then, can some people who
      do not appear to be wildly strong climb up huge walls without assistance
      from ropes and gear? Turns out, most of them are pretty good problem
      solvers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Climbing is a physical sport but using your head could make a world of
      difference. For example, one problem new climbers normally face is a hand
      hold being just out of reach. Possible solutions? One way to solve this is
      to give it a jump and hope to snag the hold before falling. Though this
      could work, a better solution would be to find a higher foothold, instead,
      and then standing up to the next hold. Another common problem accross
      climbers of all levels is arm fatigue. Besides just getting stronger, a
      way to answer this problme is to use less muscles while you climb. But,
      how?! Well typically, this means using long arms to give the back muscles
      and upper arms a little rest while you climbing. Using legs to push is
      also a very good solution to arm and upper body fatigue.

    <p>
      Rock climbing is a great sport! It is a fun alternative to weight-lifting
      but with an added mind game in order to answer physical problems.

      <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Of course, my name is Jason. I grew up in the great city of Fort Worth,
        Texas but currently reside in Houston, Texas because my job took me
        here. I hope to one day end up back in the DFW area or maybe, if I am
        lucky, Austin, Texas. I graduated from Texas A&M University with a BS in
        Chemistry and currently work for an oilfield third party laboratory. I
        enjoy maintaing a physical lifestyle filled with playing soccer, going
        to lift wieghts at the gym, and climbing in my off-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first started coding in my off-time with inspiration from my friends
        who are web-developers. I then signed up for a Udemy course to learn
        more about JS and see if this is something that I would want to pursue
        more of. Turns out that I enjoyed the problem solving process and
        creativity that can come with developing projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am hoping for a career change out of my current field by gaining the
        knowledge and experience required to do so in this course. I know it
        will ge a tough few weeks but I am excited for the challenge!
